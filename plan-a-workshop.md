# Want to organize a workshop?

## Neat!

#### The Workshop Cookbook

There is a bunch of information in the [Workshop Cookbook](https://github.com/bridgefoundry/WorkshopCookbook/wiki/Cookbook), which lives in the RailsBridge (and is equally useful for ScalaBridge!) GitHub wiki.

Read it, use it, and update it! (You just have to be logged into GitHub to make updates.)

#### Create an issue on the Organizing repo

We use GitHub to keep track of workshops in the works! If you're ready to start planning a ScalaBridge workshop, [add an issue](https://github.com/scalabridge/organization/issues/new) and we can help you as much as you need.

#### Organizing: totally doable.

A lot of organizers have never thrown an event like this before and want to know what qualifications it takes. You _don't_ have to be a born event-planner to be an awesome organizer.

Here are several things that are helpful:

*   Excitement
*   1 or 2 other people who can help you get word out to local community
*   A few hours a week leading up to the weekend for pre-workshop planning
*   Availability the weekend of the workshop
*   Some degree of organizational/logistical tendencies (or a co-organizer who is like that)
*   Ability to give a short presentation (or a co-organizer whose willing to)
*   Having attended a prior workshop as a student, teacher, volunteer, or observer.

#### Time commitment

The time commitment varies wildly based on where you're organizing and the number of workshops that have already happened in your area. If you're forging new, exciting ground, finding a venue, sponsors, students, and volunteers will take longer. The organizing cookbook [has suggestions](https://github.com/railsbridge/docs/wiki/Finding-space%2C-sponsors%2C-volunteers%2C-and-students) for where to look for those things.

The amount of time you'll need to budget will also depend on how you and your co-organizer divide the responsibilities. Everyone organizing should plan on devoting their Friday night and most of Saturday to the workshop, and at least a few hours a week during the month before the workshop to visiting the space, ordering food, and communicating with students and volunteers.

#### Mentorship & support available

If you are interested in organizing a workshop, or even just vaguely curious, contact [scalabridge@gmail.com](mailto:scalabridge@gmail.com) and our volunteerswill be very happy to talk to you about it. You can also create an issue on the [ScalaBridge Organizing GitHub repo](https://github.com/scalabridge/organization/issues/new) and we will gladly help you out!

#### Already planning?

If you're raring to go, and have already got your workshop planning underway, go you! That's amazing. Here are a couple of suggestions and requests:

*   Use [Bridge Troll](http://www.bridgetroll.org), our event management software. It'll make RSVPs and dividing up the class much, much easier.

#### Workshop Requirements

A ScalaBridge workshop has a few special things about it:

*   It is free.
*   It reaches out to one or more groups that are underrepresented in tech. We have a tradition of allowing other people to attend as a guest of a person who the workshop is reaching out to, but that is totally optional. The important thing is that the workshop brings more diverse people into tech in a welcoming, supportive environment.

If you are running an event that does not meet both of those requirements, you are welcome to use the ScalaBridge curriculum, but your event can't be called a ScalaBridge workshop.

#### Curriculum And Materials

Here is a list of useful resources, you can clone and edit the Google Docs for your own use:

*  [Curriculum, including setup instructions](https://scalabridge.gitbooks.io/curriculum/content/)
*  [Welcome Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VNwhTWBLHefoAAsCtXZdl9Hl_v7VtEALxyshli5il_o/edit?usp=sharing)
*  [Various signage](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B72QyVq_2E7_a1YxS0FFazYteGM)

The curriculum uses [Creative Scala](http://underscore.io/training/courses/creative-scala/), which was developed by the folks at Underscore. As of July 2017, it is using V2 of the curriculum.
