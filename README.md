# What is ScalaBridge?

ScalaBridge is an organization that is building a more inclusive Scala community with free, introductory programming workshops for women.

Workshops will involve a Friday evening "install-fest" and an all-day Saturday workshop.

# Who can attend?

The workshop is intended to reach out to women who are interested in learning Scala. ScalaBridge is emphatically queer and trans friendly.
